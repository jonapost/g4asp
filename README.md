Geant4 Exercises for African School of Physics 2014 Edition

Files describing the exercises (tasks) which enable students to try a few different aspects of Geant4

These files are used to generate the web site using a custom script
   ./generate-html.sh
The web site can be deployed anywhere (the current live version is on Dropbox.)

The source code for the tasks will be included here too in the future.

The configuration for this school was:
 - a central server on which Geant4 was installed  ( the OS was SLC 6.5 - Scientific Linux 6.5 )
 - each student had an account on this server and could login to the central server (over ssh on local network.)
 - many students had their own laptops ( idea to add an extra 'task': installation on laptops. ) 

History 
 - Started from the tasks created by Andrea Dotti for ASP 2010 and 2012: Geant4 exercises.
 - This was based on the tasks created by Andreas Schaelicke and Andrea Dotti for Geant4 tutorials in 2010.
