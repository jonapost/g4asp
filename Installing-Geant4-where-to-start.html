<title>Installing Geant4 - key starting points</title>
</head>
<h1>Installing Geant4</h1>

<h2>1. Using a Geant4 virtual machine</h2>
This is the simplest option, as it avoids the effort to find and install the
key pieces needed to create an installation on your own system.

<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure that your computer meets the minimum requirements:
    <ul>
      <li> Windows or Linux users : desktop or laptop PC running Windows or Linux
	with a virtualization software installed </li>
      <li> Mac users : desktop or laptop Mac running Mac OS with a virtualization software installed
      <li> 30 GB of free disk space available </li>
      <li> at least 2 GB of RAM 'free' on the PC or Mac </li>
    </ul>
      If the laptop does not meeting these requirements, the alternatives are
      a smaller virtual machine (option 2 below) or a native  installation (option 3.)
     
    </li>

  <li> Obtain a Virtual Machine 'player'. 
    You can use either the free
       <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a> software (recommended)
       or VMware software: <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html"> Workstation Player</a> on Windows, or
     <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">Fusion</a> on Mac.
     The VMware software have evaluation versions (free for 30 days.)

    For further details see http://geant4.in2p3.fr/spip.php?article65 .
  </li>

  <li> Download the Geant4 Virtual Machine
    from <a href="http://geant4.in2p3.fr/spip.php?rubrique8">
      http://geant4.in2p3.fr/spip.php?rubrique8</a>
    or directly at <a href="ftp://ftp.cenbg.in2p3.fr/info/Vmware/geant4.10.03.p02/">
      ftp://ftp.cenbg.in2p3.fr/info/Vmware/geant4.10.03.p02/ </a>
  </li>

  <li> <b> PROBLEM: </b>It is not clear exactly how to open the Image using Virtual box or
    VMware Fusion.
    Current instructions on opening images include:
    <ul>
      <li> how to open an OSboxes image using Virtual Box can be found
	at <a href="https://www.osboxes.org/guide/">https://www.osboxes.org/guide/</a> </li>
      <li> It is not clear whether the Geant4 image includes any of these
      types of files. </li>
      <li> Note: Don't forget to select 2048 MB of RAM memory.</li>
      <!---  <li> </li>  -->
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>2. Using a recent Linux Virtual Machine, and building Geant4 inside it</h2>

This is a hybrid method, which requires less disk space than the pre-built
Geant4 virtual machine, ( approximately 5 GBytes ), and uses a recent Linux
distribution.

This is the preferred method for a Windows machine which has less available
disk space (i.e. less than 40 GBytes. )

If you already have a recent Linux installation on your system, this may not be
necessary - see whether option 3 works instead.

<ul>
  <li> Obtain a Virtual Machine 'player'. See above (option 1) how to do
  this. </li>
  <li> Obtain a recent version of Linux to run inside a Virtual Machine host:
    <ul>
      <li> I found such images at <a href="http://www.osboxes.org/">
	    http://www.osboxes.org/</a>
      </li>
      <li> Some reasonable choices: <a href="https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/">Ubuntu</a> 17.04 or 17.10, or
	   <a href="https://www.osboxes.org/centos/">Centos 7</a>
      .</li>
      <li> To start a virtual machine, use the instructions at
	<a href="https://www.osboxes.org/guide/">guide</a>
      <li> To login use the credentials from the
	<a href="http://www.osboxes.org/faqs/">osboxes FAQ</a> </li>
     </ul>
   </li>
  <li> Open a 'terminal' in your Linux installation </li>
  <li> Check that you can find the compiler (<em>gcc</em>) </li>
  <li> Proceed with the installation as in Option 3 - you have a working
  Linux distribution.</li>
  <li> </li>  
</ul>

<h2>3. A Native Geant4 Installation</h2>
<br><b>An Outline of the Installation Process</b>
<br>
How to install Geant4 on your laptop or your desktop in your university/institute<br>

If you have a Linux installation from the last 3-5 years, it should be
possible to install a recent Geant4 (from the last 3 years) directly, without
a virtual machine.

To make sure that this is possible, see below for the requirements for the compiler version.
    
The method is explained fully the Installation Instructions on the Geant4 web
site.
This document prepares you and gives a few shortcuts<br>

<ul>
  <li>First check the <b>compiler</b> that you have on your system
    <ul>
      <li><em>gcc --version</em> on Linux </li>
      
      <li><em>cl -v</em>on Windows </li>
      <li><em>clang --version</em> on MacOS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Choose the <u>version of Geant4</u> to install on your system.
    You should choose a version of Geant4 which supports the compiler provided
    on your system.  ( Some newer versions of Geant4 do not support compilers
    available on older systems. )
    <ul>
      <li> If the compiler and its version are supported by the latest
	Geant4 production release, then use it!  As Geant4 10.4 is brand new
	 ( December 2017 ), let's use Geant4 10.3 instead.
         <li> Geant4 10.3 requires gcc version 4.8.5 or higher, tested with 4.9.3,
           5.3, 6.3 </li>
	 <li> If you have gcc version 7.2, then use the newest version, Geant4
	 10.4 (as this is the only version that supports it.).</li>
         <li> If you have a different subversion, e.g. 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2 or
   	      7.1 it is likely but not certain that you it will work without a
   	   problem. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  <li> You can find the latest version of Geant4 at the
    at <a href="http://cern.ch/geant4/support/download.shtml">
       Download area
    <!---  http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/download.shtml -->
    </a> or following the Download link in the home page of the Geant4 web site.
        The <a href="http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/ReleaseNotes4.10.4.html">Release
         Notes</a> document which compiler versions are supported. )
  </li>
  <li>If <b>your compiler is not supported</b>, then check the previous versions of Geant4.
	A likely candidate is release 10.1 from December 2014, which did not
	require C++ 11 support, and thus supported older compilers. 
    <ul>
      <li>For Geant4 10.3 or earlier versions, check the panel on the right of
      the Download page for the entry
	<a href="http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/source_archive.shtml">
	  Previous Releases</a> of Geant4 (since release 9.6)</li>
      <li>The second most recent release is the top entry, so you many need to scroll down
	to find the older entries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
      
  <li><b>Important:</b> you should always get the newest patch for the release
    you intend to use - for example there were 2 patches to release 10.2 in
    2016.&nbsp; Get the last one, now 10.2-patch-02</li>
  </ul>
 <h2> 4. The installation process </h2>
  <ul>
  <li> The <b>installation guide</b> is the recommended way to install Geant4.
    <ul>
      <li> Locate the official installation guide in the "Support" pages of the Geant4 web site
	<ul>
             <li>for the latest release, which is currently Geant4 10.3 (patch 3), it is
	       at <a href="http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html">http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html</a></li>
	     <li>for previous versions of Geant4 you can find it
	       at <a href="http://geant4.cern.ch/support/userdocuments.shtml">http://geant4.cern.ch/support/userdocuments.shtml</a></li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li> I suggest that you download the PDF version of the istallation guide
	for the version of Geant4 that you will use. After this you can search
	it - or just use it as backup.
      </li> 
      <li> I will not repeat information which is in the guide - this
	page is just an outline!</li>
      <li>When you have a question, please look for an answer in the
	      relevant section and then ask if you do not find an answer!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li> Some key points for particular systems.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Linux Installation</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>CMake: Make sure that you have 'cmake', and that its version is at least 3.3 (for the latest
	    Geant4). You can find links where to get it, and guidance in the
	    Installation guide ( and cmake.org )  On Ubuntu and similar systems, you can
	    simply say 'sudo apt get cmake' in a terminal to get it using apt-get.
	  </li> 
	  <li>Source code - download either the 'tar.gz' file (preferred) or
	    the zip file if you can use 'unzip'
