 \mainpage task1 Task 1 Exercises Geant4 Physics

\section s1 OBJECTIVE

Understand of processes and models active in one physics list

  - Check which processes are attached to pion, proton, and neutron
 

Visualize hadronic showers, and get impression on difference of EM and hadronic 
showers.

  - shower shape
  - shower start
  - particle composition of showers

 
\section s2 HOW

  - prepare the environment (tell the Geant4 build system where to find things):
\verbatim
       % source ~/geant4.sh
\endverbatim

    If this does not work, instead say
\verbatim
       % source /usr/local/share/geant4/geant4.sh
\endverbatim
*/

//  ALTERNATIVE:
//	% wget http://cern.ch/adotti/setupG4.sh
//	% source setupG4.sh

/**
  - get the source code 
\verbatim
        % cp /usr/local/share/geant4/tasks/task1.tgz . 
	% wget http://cern.ch/adotti/task1.tgz
\endverbatim

  - unpack it
\verbatim
	% tar -xzf task1.tgz
\endverbatim

  - see what it has created in your directory:
\verbatim
	% ls
        % ls task1
\endverbatim

  - compile and generate an executable:
\verbatim
        % cd task1
	% make
\endverbatim
  - and run it: 
\verbatim
	% task1
	% task1
\endverbatim

  
\section s3a PRACTICE

\subsection s3asub1 Exercise 1.0: Learn about processes

     Try to understand the processes attached to pi-, proton, and 
     neutron. Are there differences, if so why?
     
     The command /process/list will show processes for all particles. To
     see processes fro a single particle, run task1, and study the commands 
     /particles/process/dump, and /particle/select. To inspect the processes 
     assigned to pi-, use
     \verbatim
	/particle/select pi-
	/particle/process/dump -1
     \endverbatim

     As and example, the difference of processes between pi+ and pi- is 
     the additional CaptureAtRest process for the negative pion.
 
\subsection s3asub2 Exercise 1.1: Models within processes

     The Geant4 particle and process commands do not (yet) allow to inspect the 
     models and cross-section used within the process. This information is 
     printed by default at the start of a run, for selected particles.
     Locate this output searching for "HADRONIC PROCESSES SUMMARY". For a pion,
     understand which models are used for inelastic interactions. To get this
     output, you have to start a run:
     \verbatim
      % $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/task1
      at the prompt type
        /run/beamOn 0
     \endverbatim
     
     Optional: To see the processes/models for all particles, you need to change
     the verbosity level for G4HadronicProcessStore. To do so, uncomment the
     relevant line in task1.cc, rebuild, and re-run.  

\subsection s3bsub1 Exercise 1.2

     Start to understand differences of the showershape
     using task5 to run a few events using electrons and pi+ as primary
     particles, using  1 GeV kinetic energy for the primary. To get a better 
     idea about different particle types there is a macro particleColour.mac
     setting the colour of tracks according to particle type.
     
     Study the particleColour.mac macro to understand the colours used for
     different particles.
     
     To run task5 for five events each, do
     
     \verbatim
     $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/task1
        at the prompt type
     /control/execute particleColour.mac
     /gps/particle e-
     /gps/energy 1 GeV
     
     /run/beamOn 5
     
     /gps/particle pi-
     /run/beamOn 5
     
     \endverbatim
     
     You will find EM showers mostly gray,i.e. gamma, and hadronic showers
     mostly green, i.e. neutrons. These domination is mostly due to low energy
     particles. Neutrons and gamma do not loose energy due to ionisation, and
     the lower cross sestion for other interactions results in larger pathlength.
